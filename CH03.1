#This is CH03-1 assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to prompt the user to input number of hours worked, hourly rate and output pay amount.
#If hours worked is over 40 hours, calculate overtime pay (1.5 times of hourly rate).  If hours worked is over 60 hours, calculate double overtime pay (2 times of hourly rate).
#Also, if the program detects wrong input (entering characters, negative numbers, etc.) the program displays a message informing the user of wrong input.

try:

    hours = float(input('Please enter the amount of hours worked\n'))   #First create try/except rules for hours to seperate errors such as negative or letters.

    if hours <= 0:

        print ('You have entered wrong information for hours.')

except:
    print ('You have entered wrong information for hours.')

try:

    rates = float(input('Please enter the hourly rate\n'))              #Second thing to do is create try/except rules for rates.

    if rates <= 0:

        print ('You have entered wrong rate information.')
except:
    print ('You have entered wrong rate information.')

                                            
try:                                                                    #Finally, we calculate the the pay total depending on hours and rates.
    if 0 < hours <= 40:   

        total = hours * rates

        print('Your total is', total)


    elif 41 < hours <= 60:

        ohours = hours - 40

        total = (ohours * rates * 1.5) + ((hours - ohours) * rates)

        print ('Your total is', total)

    elif hours > 60:

        ohours = 20

        dhours = hours - 60

        total = (ohours * rates *1.5) + (dhours * rates * 2) + ((hours - ohours - dhours) * rates)

        print('Your total is', total)

except:
    print('You have entered an invalid input.')
